# The Publishing Process

Big Fish Games specializes in a collaborative, engaging approach to publishing your games. Each studio who partners with us is assigned a Producer to walk 
them through each step of the process.

Our publishing process involves five steps:

- **Contract**: Contract is signed by both parties.
- **Onboarding**: Kickoff meeting is held with Big Fish Games & partner studio. A Big Fish producer is assigned to the partner studio.
- **Feature Implementation**: The feature set is decided upon and implemented into the game code.
- **Release Management**: Big Fish sets up the game in the Apple app and/or Google Play stores. Automatic build systems release builds as needed. Game is
published by Big Fish.
- **Ongoing Support**: Big Fish will continue to update the SDK and other required services throughout the life of the game. Support is provided on a
regular cadence.
